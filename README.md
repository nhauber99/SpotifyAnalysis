# SpotifyAnalysis

Python script for processing the Spotify streaming history. There are a few examples to save statistics like top artists or tracks, but is also aimed to be adapted however you please.

To request your streaming history visit this link: [https://www.spotify.com/account/privacy/](https://www.spotify.com/account/privacy/)

Place your extracted json files into a "Data" directory, install the dependencies (only pandas) and run the script. Some .csv files will be placed in a "Results" directory, just open those with your favourite spreadsheet application. 

You can also select the "uri" column and copy the values into a Spotify playlist which automatically adds the correct tracks, this allows for creating some pretty large playlists:
